# README BEFORE USING THE SCRIPT:
# This auto-camera-fitting script assists in fitting camera parameters when limited information is available. 
# The script estimates parameters based on GPS and pixel locations.

# ASSUMPTIONS:
# - The labeled points in autocameratransform.py have an elevation of 0. If not, please specify the elevation.
# - At a minimum, provide one of the following: `focallength_mm`, `view_x_deg`, or `view_y_deg`, as well as a sample image frame and the GPS location of the camera.

# STEPS TO USE THE SCRIPT:
# 1. Fill in the parameters in this .yaml file. For unknown parameters, set them to `null`.
# 2. Label points in autocameratransform.py with pixel coordinates (e.g., [1920, 1080]) and corresponding GPS coordinates (e.g., [39.97109148165551, -86.07059324551214]).
# 3. Run the script with `python autocameratransform.py`.

# Known parameters of the camera
camera_parameters:
  # RECTILINEAR PROJECTION PARAMETERS
  # Set one of the following: `focallength_mm`, `view_x_deg`, or `view_y_deg`.
  rectilinear_projection:
    focallength_mm: null           # Focal length in millimeters. Set to `null` if unknown.
    view_x_deg: 80                 # Horizontal field of view in degrees. Mandatory if `focallength_mm` is `null`.
    view_y_deg: null               # Vertical field of view in degrees. Optional; set if known.
    sensor_width_mm: null          # Sensor width in millimeters.
    sensor_height_mm: null         # Sensor height in millimeters.

  # SPATIAL ORIENTATION PARAMETERS (you may also set an object like {min: 0, max: 10, init: 5} to set fit constraints)
  spatial_orientation:
    # heading_deg: null              # Camera heading in degrees, north is the reference. Do not set if unknown.
    # tilt_deg: null                 # Camera tilt angle in degrees. Do not set if unknown.
    # roll_deg: null                 # Camera roll angle in degrees. Do not set if unknown.
    # elevation_m: null              # Camera elevation in meters. Do not set if unknown.
    pos_x_m: 0                       # X position of the camera in meters; set to 0 for origin.
    pos_y_m: 0                       # Y position of the camera in meters; set to 0 for origin.

  # BROWN LENS DISTORTION PARAMETERS (you may also set an object like {min: 0, max: 10, init: 5} to set fit constraints)
  brown_lens_distortion:
    # k1: null                       # Distortion coefficient k1. Do not set if unknown.
    # k2: null                       # Distortion coefficient k2. Do not set if unknown.
    k3: 0                            # Distortion coefficient k3. Do not set if unknown.

  # GPS LOCATION OF THE CAMERA (mandatory)
  gps_location:
    lat: 0
    lon: 0

landmarks:
  - [[0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]            # Format: [[px_x, px_y], [lat, lon, elev_m]]

# ITERATION SETTINGS FOR METROPOLIS OPTIMIZATION
iteration_num: 10000               # Number of iterations for the Metropolis optimization.

# TOP VIEW SETTINGS
top_view:
  do_plot: true                    # Set to `true` to generate a top-view image; `false` to disable.
  extent: [-100, 100, -100, 100]       # Extent of the top view in meters: [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max].
                                   # Leave as `null` to auto-calculate an appropriate extent.
  m_per_pixel: 0.05                # Scaling factor for top view; represents meters per pixel. 
                                   # Leave as `null` for auto-scaling.

# OPTION TO SAVE FITTED CAMERA PARAMETERS
save_cam: true                     # Set to `true` to save the fitted camera parameters; `false` to disable.
