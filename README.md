# Vision Pipeline (SAE core) for Kubernetes / Docker Compose
This repository contains much of the documentation and orchestrating configuration for the container-based vision pipeline (which is the only supported version now).

## Repositories
The components of the vision pipeline can be found in the following repositories:

## Contents
- `/doc` - Documentation of the architecture and some details of the technical setup
- `/helm/sae` - The main Helm chart
- `/docker-compose` - A docker compose version of the pipeline (should be more or less up-to-date with the Helm chart)
- `/tools` - Contains the `watch` script which makes visually introspecting the pipeline easy (can render image output for every stage)
- `/nvidia` - Some rough documentation about setting up K3s with Nvidia properly (needs to be extended / automated)
- `/dashboards` - A place to save created dashboards for viewing the pipeline metrics (not part of the demo setup yet)

## Helm Chart Release
The Helm chart is automatically released to our internal Helm repository on every push into `main`. Also, if you want to build and release locally, you can just run `helm/do_release.sh`.
