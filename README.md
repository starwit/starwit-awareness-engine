# Starwit Awareness Engine
This is an umbrella repository containing much of the documentation and orchestration code for the Starwit Awareness Engine.
It links to all relevant components and is meant to be the place to start exploring the SAE project.

## Prerequisites

* for sae components, you need python 3.11, you can switch between python versions with pyenv:
    * see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment
    * `curl -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash`
    * choose python version with `pyenv local 3.11.9`
* install python3 venv (e.g. sudo apt install python3.11-venv)

## Contents
- [`/doc`](doc/README.md) - Documentation of the architecture and some details of the technical setup
- [`/helm/sae`](helm/sae) - The SAE Helm chart
- [`/docker-compose`](docker-compose/README.md) - A docker compose version of the pipeline (usually up-to-date with the Helm version)
- [`/tools`](tools/README.md) - Contains scripts which help introspecting the pipeline state and developing new components. E.g. visualizing frames with annotations, drawing objects onto a map or recording and playing pipeline state to/from a file.
- [`/nvidia`](nvidia/notes.md) - Some rough documentation about setting up K3s with Nvidia properly.
- [`/dashboards`](dashboards/) - A place to save created dashboards for viewing the pipeline metrics (not part of the compose setup yet)

## SemVer conventions
As this is highly debatable, here is what we are currently trying to maintain:
- Patch version: This is increased if neither the public API of the artifact in question is changed nor any new features are implemented. Upgrade should be possible without any changes to config or setup. Dependency bumps are also included, if the preceding constraints are fulfilled.
- Minor version: This is increased if the component changes its public API in a downwards compatible way (that usually means the new feature extends the existing functionality and has some sane defaults). Upgrade should be possible without any changes to the configuration.
- Major version: This is increased if the component changes its public API in a non-downwards-compatible way and changes to configuration / infrastructure / etc. have to be made to upgrade.

## How-To Prod Install

### Installation Steps
1. Set up K3s cluster \
    - Create K3s config file (adapt the value of `tls-san`)
        ```yaml
        write-kubeconfig-mode: "0644"
        tls-san:
            - "TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME"
        disable:
            - servicelb
            - traefik
        ```
        - `tls-san` only has to be set if the hostname the cluster is supposed to be managed through is not equal to the actual hostname (e.g. it is on Tailscale)
        - As we currently do not open any ports and do not host publicly host any services `traefik` and `servicelb` can be disabled
        - `--write-kubeconfig-mode 644` enables managing the cluster through any user on the machine
    - Install K3s `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s -`
    - If the machine you install K3s on has a NVIDIA GPU available and wants to use it for running the pipeline, 
    you have to follow the instructions in [`./nvidia/notes.md`](nvidia/notes.md)
2. Install Timescale DB (if do not have one on another machine and you want to store the pipeline output data)
    - Create a database for pipeline data and a table / hypertable. See [`./doc/database.md`](doc/database.md) for instructions.
3. Install SAE
    - Copy the values template file and adapt it to your needs (see the file for information)
        ```sh
        cp ./helm/sae/customvalues.template my.values.yaml
        ``` 
    - Install helm chart
        ```sh
        helm install <release-name> oci://registry-1.docker.io/starwitorg/sae -f my.values.yaml
        ```
4. Set up and use the watch tool in [`tools/`](tools/watch.py) to inspect the pipeline visually
5. Check out the internal pipeline metrics
    - Forward Grafana port to your local machine and log in (user admin, password admin)
    - Import dashboard [`./dashboards/sae_overview.json`](/dashboards/sae_overview.json) into Grafana

## How-To Dev
There are many ways of how to run the pipeline for local developments on individual components.
Because all components communicate through Redis streams it does not matter where or how the pipeline is running.
As long as the Redis port of the pipeline instance is available on the local machine, a locally started version
(possibly within the IDE, e.g. in debug mode) can be hooked into the pipeline.
For port forwarding either k9s or `kubectl port-forward` can be used (or any other K8s tool).
The compose-based version of the pipeline can be used for maximum (or rather most convenient) 
control over individual components (see [`/docker-compose`](docker-compose/README.md)).
